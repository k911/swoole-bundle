## Quick start guide

1. Make sure you have installed proper Swoole PHP Extension and pass other [requirements](#requirements).

2. (optional) Create a new symfony project

    ```bash
    composer create-project symfony/skeleton project

    cd ./project
    ```

3. Install bundle in your symfony application

    ```bash
    composer require k911/swoole-bundle
    ```

4. Edit `config/bundles.php`

    ```php
    return [
        // ...other bundles
        K911\Swoole\Bridge\Symfony\Bundle\SwooleBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    ];
    ```

5. Run Swoole HTTP Server

    ```bash
    bin/console swoole:server:run
    ```

6. Enter http://localhost:9501

7. You can now configure bundle according to your needs

## Features

- Built-in API Server

    Swoole Bundle API Server allows to manage Swoole HTTP Server in real time.

    - Reload worker processes
    - Shutdown server
    - Access metrics and settings

- Improved static files serving

    Swoole HTTP Server provides a default static files handler, but it lacks supporting many `Content-Types`. In order to overcome this issue, there is (not yet configurable) Advanced Static Files Server. Static files serving is enabled by default in development environment. Static files directory defaults to `%kernel.project_dir%/public`.

- Hot Module Reload (HMR) - for development

    Since Swoole HTTP Server runs in Event Loop and do not flush memory between requests, to keep DX equal with normal servers, this bundle uses code replacement techinque, using `inotify` PHP Extension to allow contionus development. It is enabled by default (when extension is found), and requires no additional configuration. You can turn it off in bundle configuration.

## Requirements

- PHP version `>= 7.2.19`
- Swoole PHP Extension `>= 4.3.6`
- Symfony `>= 4.2.10`

Additional requirements to enable specific features:

- [Inotify PHP Extension](https://pecl.php.net/package/inotify) `^2.0.0` to use Hot Module Reload (HMR)
